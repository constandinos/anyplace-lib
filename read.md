Anyplace Simulator
================

A trace-driven simulator for the Anyplace Indoor Localization Service. 
The simulator connects directly with the Anyplace API and is written in JAVA. 
It allows developers to test various ideas on top of Anyplace before prototyping them in a real setting.

Installation
----
Make sure you have [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) tool installed in your system. 
The following commands, clone the repository and build the simulator project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmsl/anyplace.git && cd simulator
mvn package
```
Runnable jars will be produced in their corresponding directory.

Usage
---

#### DataConnector

This service fetches the building with the specified _buid_. It 
creates two directories: graphs and fingerprints.
```bash
java -jar DataConnector/target/DataConnector-1.0.jar [buid]


```

#### DatasetCreator

This service creates the dataset for a building. 
It requires the files of the building from the **_DataConnector Service_**. 

```bash
java -jar DatasetCreator/target/DatasetCreator-1.0.jar

```
#### Simulator

This service implements all the algorithms along with evaluation metrics.
```bash
java -jar Simulator/target/Simulator-1.0.jar

```

#### Visualizer
This service shows the graph generated by various building plans and also allows tracing 
the algorithms to understand their behaviour.

```bash
java -jar Visualizer/target/Visualizer-1.0.jar

```
#### TracesCreator

This service creates traces from the behaviour of different types of people (e.g., students, faculty members)
 for the specified building.  
```bash
java -jar TracesCreator/target/TracesCreator-1.0.jar

```


Examples
---

1. Run the DataConnector to fetch the Computer Science building of the University of Cyprus:
```bash
java -jar DataConnector/target/DataConnector-1.0.jar username_1373876832005
```

2. Run the DatasetCreator to create a dataset
```bash
java -jar DatasetCreator/target/DatasetCreator-1.0.jar
```

3. Run the Simulator to build the algorithms
```bash
java -jar Simulator/target/Simulator-1.0.jar
```

4. Run the Visualizer application to visualize the algorithms
```bash
java -jar Visualizer/target/Visualizer-1.0.jar

```
