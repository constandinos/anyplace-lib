Anyplace Library
================

A standalone java library that provides access to a set of endpoints from the [Anyplace API](https://ap.cs.ucy.ac.cy/developers/). The library connects directly with the Anyplace API and is written in JAVA. The clients of this library collect the WiFi fingerprints from a building and use this library for localization. The library has been testing on linux, mac and android systems.

Installation
----
Make sure you have [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) tool installed in your system. 
The following command clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/constandinos/anyplace-lib.git && cd anyplace-lib
```

Usage
---
#### Linux and Mac Client
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -<endpoint> <parameters>
```

#### Examples
Get all annotated buildings:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -buildingAll
```

Get all floors of a building:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -allBuildingFloors <buid>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -allBuildingFloors username_1373876832005
```

Get all POI connections inside a floor:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -connectionsByFloor <buid> <floor>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -connectionsByFloor username_1373876832005 1
```

Get all positions with their respective Wi-Fi radio measurements:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -heatmapBuidFloor <buid> <floor>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -heatmapBuidFloor username_1373876832005 1
```

Radiomap using all the entries near the coordinate parameters:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -radioBuidFloor <buid> <floor>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -radioBuidFloor username_1373876832005 1
```

Estimate the location of the user:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosition <operating_system> <buid> <floor> <algorithm>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosition linux username_1373876832005 1 1
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosition mac username_1373876832005 1 1
```

Estimate the location of the user offline. Needs the radiomap file:
```bash
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosOffline <operating_system> <buid> <floor> <algorithm>
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosOffline linux username_1373876832005 1 1
java -jar jar/anyplace-lib.jar -estimatePosOffline mac username_1373876832005 1 1
```
